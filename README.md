# Data Analysis in Ruby (DARby)

## Setup

1. Install the Ruby version specified in `.ruby-version` using any ruby version manager that works for you. I recommend [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Make sure bundler is installed with `gem install bundler`

1. Install Jupyter notebooks however you want (`brew install jupyterlab`)

1. Run `bundle install` to install all required gems

1. Export the required keys as environment variables. Currently just `export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=key`. If you don't have a key, get one for free from [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)

1. Start up the Jupyter notebooks with `bundle exec jupyter notebook`
