This Finance section aims to provide average buy-and-hold investors with real data-backed analysis on common portfolios and asset allocations.
It is inspired heavily by the wonderful data any trading site will provide you about any given stock or mutual fund, but unavailable for real portfolio analysis.

The main areas of focus are returns (as defined by hypothetical growth over time), and risk (as defined by various volatility metrics as well as maximum drawdown percentage).

[<Title text="Portfolios" />](/portfolios/)
The [**Portfolios**](/portfolios/) page contains a list of analyzed ETF-based portfolios with links to detailed anaysis pages.

Each Portfolio will display historical returns, volatility, and other metrics to help you pick the right asset allocation for you.

[<Title text="Stocks" />](/stocks/)
The [**Stocks**](/stocks/) page is the same thing but for individual stocks and ETF.
Every stock that makes up the Portfolios listed above will have a individual stock page to show how it affects the portfolio as a whole.
